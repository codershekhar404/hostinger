## About Project

 [**Technohacks**](https://technohacks.co.in/)

Welcome to the Hostinger Clone project, my third and final project developed as part of my internship. This project is a clone of the Hostinger website created using React.js. It aims to replicate the key features and the design of the Hostinger website.

The Hostinger Clone project is an exercise in web development and React.js. It demonstrates my skills in creating a dynamic and interactive web application that mimics the appearance and behavior of the Hostinger website. This project includes various components and features found on the Hostinger site, offering a close-to-real user experience.
